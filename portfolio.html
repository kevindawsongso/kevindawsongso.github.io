    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <details class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-md transition duration-300">
      <summary class="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">Vulnerability Management & Compliance Framework Lab</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Project Snapshot</strong><br>Simulated real-world vulnerability testing to evaluate system compliance against industry-standard security frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and OWASP Top 10.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Context & Motivation</strong><br>I wanted to explore how vulnerability scanning aligns with governance frameworks and control baselines. This lab helped me bridge technical execution with broader risk and compliance strategies.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Thought Process & Decision-Making</strong><br>I selected systems with known weaknesses and scanned them using Nessus and OpenVAS. The focus was on detecting gaps against predefined controls. Mapping findings to NIST and ISO controls revealed inconsistencies in patching cadence and access controls. I prioritized fixes based on exploitability and regulatory relevance.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Used Tenable Nessus to detect critical vulnerabilities across Windows and Linux hosts.</li>
        <li>Correlated findings with OWASP Top 10 and CIS benchmarks.</li>
        <li>Created a remediation plan and measured improvements by re-running scans.</li>
        <li>Logged all vulnerabilities and mitigations for audit reporting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>What I Learned / What’s Next</strong><br>This lab deepened my understanding of how technical risk maps to compliance obligations. Next, I plan to automate baseline checks using scripts and integrate scan results with SIEM alerts.</p>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <details class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-md transition duration-300">
      <summary class="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">AWS Cloud Security & Threat Detection Lab</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Project Snapshot</strong><br>Designed and deployed a cloud honeypot on AWS to collect real-world attack data and refine detection strategies using native AWS tools.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Context & Motivation</strong><br>I wanted hands-on experience with cloud-native security controls and real-world telemetry. This lab gave me insight into attacker behavior and AWS threat visibility.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Thought Process & Decision-Making</strong><br>T-Pot was deployed on an EC2 instance to simulate vulnerable services. I segmented traffic using VPCs and security groups to isolate malicious activity. AWS GuardDuty and Detective were used for detection and correlation. I tuned AWS WAF rules in response to observed brute-force attempts.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Deployed T-Pot honeypot stack on EC2.</li>
        <li>Configured VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty, and Detective for threat telemetry.</li>
        <li>Captured and analyzed RDP/SSH brute-force attempts.</li>
        <li>Created custom WAF rules to block malicious IPs in real-time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>What I Learned / What’s Next</strong><br>This project taught me how AWS services interconnect for layered cloud defense. Next, I’ll explore Lambda automation for response and use Athena to query logs for long-term patterns.</p>

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <details class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-md transition duration-300">
      <summary class="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">Cloud Risk Assessment & Threat Intelligence Lab</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Project Snapshot</strong><br>Simulated cloud-based attacks and defensive responses to assess risk, visibility, and control gaps in AWS environments.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Context & Motivation</strong><br>I wanted to sharpen my ability to assess cloud risks from both offensive and defensive angles. This lab helped me understand how threat intelligence feeds into cloud defense planning.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Thought Process & Decision-Making</strong><br>I deliberately misconfigured IAM and security groups to test detection capabilities. Attacks were simulated via Kali Linux. I monitored telemetry with CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and custom dashboards to map risks and responses.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Conducted IAM misconfig and brute-force attack simulations.</li>
        <li>Mapped detection events to MITRE ATT&CK cloud techniques.</li>
        <li>Integrated GuardDuty findings into a centralized risk dashboard.</li>
        <li>Analyzed IOCs and attacker patterns to inform WAF hardening.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>What I Learned / What’s Next</strong><br>This lab showed how small misconfigurations can lead to massive exposure. I plan to build a continuous compliance check using AWS Config and Security Hub next.</p>

    <!-- Project 4 -->
    <details class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-md transition duration-300">
      <summary class="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">SIEM & IDS/IPS Cybersecurity Simulation Lab</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Project Snapshot</strong><br>Built a hybrid SOC-style environment to monitor real-time security events, simulate threats, and execute incident response.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Context & Motivation</strong><br>To get closer to real-world SOC operations, I built a custom lab to practice event triage, log correlation, and detection engineering.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Thought Process & Decision-Making</strong><br>I combined Splunk for SIEM, Suricata for IDS, pfSense for segmentation, and Nessus for vulnerability scans. Each tool served a purpose in simulating a functional SOC pipeline. I used Kali Linux for red team ops and closed the loop with defensive actions.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Centralized logs via Splunk with Sysmon and Suricata feeds.</li>
        <li>Simulated Nmap scans and basic exploits via Kali Linux.</li>
        <li>Validated Suricata alerts against Splunk correlation rules.</li>
        <li>Used Nessus to identify and patch known vulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>What I Learned / What’s Next</strong><br>I learned to think in terms of attack paths and detection gaps. I’d like to extend this lab by integrating SOAR playbooks or building out MITRE-based detection rules in Splunk.</p>

    <!-- Project 5 -->
    <details class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-5 shadow-md transition duration-300">
      <summary class="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">SIEM & Security Control Validation Lab</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Project Snapshot</strong><br>Focused on validating existing security controls through targeted attack simulations and reviewing log coverage and correlation effectiveness.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Context & Motivation</strong><br>I wanted to assess not just what tools were in place, but how effective they really were. This lab emphasized validation over implementation.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Thought Process & Decision-Making</strong><br>Using open-source SIEM tools, I replayed known attack patterns and traced detection events. I modified log retention policies and dashboards to improve coverage and reduce false positives.</p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Used test scripts and attack frameworks to simulate credential dumping, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.</li>
        <li>Verified alert generation in SIEM dashboards.</li>
        <li>Tuned rules to reduce noise and emphasize high-fidelity signals.</li>
        <li>Documented which controls were effective and which failed silently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300"><strong>What I Learned / What’s Next</strong><br>This reinforced that visibility without validation is a trap. I aim to continue refining detection coverage using threat emulation tools like Atomic Red Team and build reporting scripts for regular validation.</p>
